## TradingPlatform - Github Pages

A stock trading simulator for friends and family to use to be able to have a low-stakes, no-money-involved way to test if their predictions, strategies, and analyses are profitable in the stock market.

The user enters the ticker of the stock they want to buy, along with the number of shares, to purchase and add to their portfolio. Live stock prices are fetched from my own [StockMarketAPI](https://sebaraj.com/StockMarketAPI/) and the portfolios are stored in a MongoDB database, allowing for users to track, over the span of days, months, or years, their unrealized profits/losses and their return on investment (for each position). 

Adapted for desktop and mobile use.
